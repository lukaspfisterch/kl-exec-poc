# KL Execution PoC 0.1.0

This repository builds on the **KL Kernel Logic foundations** and explores
how KL can be used as a small execution fabric with:

- an operation registry
- an orchestrator that calls into the KL Kernel
- deterministic and later non deterministic example operations

Scope:

- Keep the code inspectable and compact.
- Focus on structure, policy and traceability.
- Avoid premature infrastructure concerns.

The KL foundations themselves live in a separate repository that defines
Psi, CAEL and the Kernel with deterministic examples.
